# 🦈 Decoding Shark Risk — Global Intelligence Report

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project analyzes over **7,000 global shark incidents** to understand when, where, and under what conditions shark encounters most frequently occur.  
As a consultancy specializing in **nature–wildlife interaction and coastal safety analytics**, our goal is to replace fear and myths with **facts and actionable intelligence**.

---

## ✍️ Project Description  
Using real-world historical shark incident data, we:
- Transform raw, chaotic data into a clean and structured dataset  
- Extract meaningful patterns using exploratory data analysis  
- Identify demographic, seasonal, and geographic risk factors  
- Translate insights into business-relevant recommendations  

---

## 💡 Value Proposition  
We provide **science-based clarity** for industries and institutions that depend on coastal safety:
- Turning fear into understanding  
- Turning raw data into intelligence  
- Supporting safer human–wildlife coexistence  

---

## 👥 Target Stakeholders  
- **Tourism & Hospitality** — enhance visitor experience & safety behavior  
- **Government & Coastal Authorities** — protect coastal communities  
- **Healthcare Providers** — plan resources around seasonal risk  
- **Animal Protection Associations** — communicate accurate, evidence-based information  

---

## 📦 Deliverable  
**Global Shark Risk Intelligence Report**  
A fully processed and analyzed dataset supported by visual insights and strategic conclusions.

---

## 🎯 Analysis Goal  
Transform messy shark incident records into **reliable, structured intelligence** to help decision-makers better understand and manage coastal risk environments.

---

## 🧹 Data Wrangling & Cleaning  
This dataset required extensive preprocessing, including:
- Handling missing and inconsistent values  
- Fixing incorrect or ambiguous records  
- Standardizing dates, countries, and locations  
- Grouping 100+ unstructured activity labels  
- Creating derived features such as  
  `Season`, `Year Group`, `Age Category`, and `Activity Type`

## 🎯 Hypotheses  

**Core Assumption**  
Shark incidents are not random — they follow **predictable patterns** driven by season, geography, activity, and demographics.

**H1 — Seasonality**  
Incidents peak during warm summer months.

**H2 — Geography**  
Most incidents occur in a few hotspot countries: USA, Australia, South Africa.

**H3 — Activity Type**  
Surfing and swimming account for the highest risk.

**H4 — Victim Profile**  
Incidents are significantly more common among males and younger adults.

**H5 — Time Trend**  
Incidents increase over decades as human ocean activity increases.

_All hypotheses were confirmed through data analysis._

---

## ✅ Key Insights  
- ~70% of incidents occur during **summer months**
- USA, Australia, and South Africa account for most global incidents
- **Surfing (~73%)** and swimming represent highest-risk activities
- **~80% of victims are male**
- Young adults (20–30) represent the largest risk group
- Incidents increase notably from 1900 onwards with rising ocean activity

---

## 🏁 Business Impact  
The results support:
- Smarter coastal risk management  
- Better tourism communication and safety planning  
- Healthcare preparedness for seasonal peaks  
- Balanced human–wildlife coexistence strategies
